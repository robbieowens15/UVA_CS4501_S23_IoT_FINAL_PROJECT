Using official ROS Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/_/ros

## Setup
Steps for setup (assume docker desktop installed and running)

```
docker pull ros

# Note, this docker file is not need rn, but as we change the container
(e.g. install libraries, change networking settings, etc)
We can edit and append this file to create new Docker images (thus spinning up)
containers which fulfill our changing requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cat Dockerfile
FROM ros:foxy

# install ros package
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
      ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-demo-nodes-cpp \
      ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-demo-nodes-py && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# launch ros package
CMD ["ros2", "launch", "demo_nodes_cpp", "talker_listener.launch.py"]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Create location on host file system for mount:
mkdir ./mnt/

#start ROS container
docker run -d \
-it \
--name mower \
--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/mnt,target=/root/mnt \
ros

#lookup name of the ROS container
#N.B. Must open a NEW TERMINAL SESSION ON HOST MACHINE
docker ps -l
#e.g. output
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
9699b018e4cc   ros       "/ros_entrypoint.sh â€¦"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes             mower

#stop ROS container
docker stop mower

#start docker container
docker start mower

#start a new terminal session within container (FROM HOST MACHINE SHELL)
docker exec -it mower bash
```

Notes for future: 
- may be useful to open port for ROS service calls
- if (above) too complete, place "systems calls" as files in mnt

### Configuring the Ubuntu OS in the container to run ROS2

following: http://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html
- I followed this tutorial through and verified setup in the pub-sub at bottom of the page
Note, by following this I have warning about two ROS installs

Now after this setup is it possible to source correctly via:
`source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`

### Building the workspace
following this tutorial: http://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Colcon-Tutorial.html

# File structure organization
- `mnt/project_ws` is for the code to simulate service calls to the robot lawn mower about battery levels and such
- `mnt/ros2_sandbox_ws` is for running doing the ROS tutorials linked below

## Creating the Simulated Mover Robot

Following this guide to create simple Python pub/sub: http://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html

And this guide on service calls: http://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html

possible solution to communicating through docker container
https://github.com/uts-magic-lab/rosduct

# Running the demo

Build the project:
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
cd /root/mnt/project_ws
colcon build --packages-select python_parameters
source install/setup.bash
```

Run the battery count down: *Bug! Functionality to modify the count down is broken*
`ros2 launch battery_monitor battery_monitor_launch.py battery_time:="10"` 10 is 10s til battery depletes
or `ros2 launch battery_monitor battery_monitor_launch.py` battery_time default is 100s

## Troubleshoot

Error ROS2 not found: `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`

## Cleanup
'''
docker rm mower
'''
